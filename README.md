Versatile Encoding
==================

A binary, read-off-the-wire encoding format and bi-directional stream or packet oriented protocol supporting most standard data types and basic container types.

See the various .md files for descriptions.

There's a basic Java (mostly complete) implementation as a proof-of-concept.

Status
------

This project is still a work-in-progress. The binary format is motly there, as is a basic Java implementation including most parts of the transport layer, but the session layer still needs work.
